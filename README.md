<h2> Development (*Àä·óúÀã*)/·µó·ëã·µÉ·ê¢·µè ·µû·µí·µò*</h2>

You already know how to setup the dev environment.<br />It's just a normal React App ( Àò‚ñΩÀò)„Å£‚ô®

Anyways, make sure your node version is 18.x and yarn is the latest stable version.

### Install Deps

```bash
yarn install
```

### Start the Development Environment

```bash
yarn start
```

As easy as that Ÿ©(Ôºæ‚ó°Ôºæ)€∂

## PR Guidelines („Å• ‚óï‚Äø‚óï )„Å•

### Branch naming

`TYPE-ISSUE_ID-DESCRIPTION`

`TYPE`:
- `feat` - a new feature
- `doc` - documentation only changes
- `fix` - a bug fix
- `refactor` - code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

`ISSUE_ID`: Github Issue ID

`DESCRIPTION`: A small description which explains what changes you have done

Make sure the target branch is `dev-react`

## What else? (‚óî„Éò‚óî)
